# AI Vacuum Cleaner Program

This AI vacuum is the first project I completed in my artificial intelligence elective class. This python program is based on a 4x4 grid which represents a room layout. After user picks a square to be dirty, the algorithm performs both breadth first search and depth first search to find the location of the dirt. After comparing both searches, the vacuum chooses the quickest method and proceeds to clean. All of the vacuum's movement is displayed in a GUI.
